# MyForm
A form building and reading software, I made it up with Python.

This is a crazy project

creator: I am crazy! I am crazy! I am crazy! I am crazy! I am crazy! I am crazy!

Ooooook, here are the data standard of the form

we change everything can break the rule(for example, the "{}",can be mix with the control {})

so, here is an example

8   9   10
a   b   c
{   }   ,
/   0   0

|
V

{{8,9,10},{a,b,c},{/{,/},/,},{//,0,0}}

so you see? the char "/" have made great use! It makes the rule-breaking chars "Harmless" !

there is a bug.
After reopening, char "," will be "/"

Probably start.txt will give you more information...
